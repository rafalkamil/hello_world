# hello_world, I'm Rafa≈Ç 

I graduated as a civil engineer but coding has always been my passion which has now become lifestyle. 
Problem solving, building things from scratch, creating something that serves people, reinventing and optimizing - this has always been my goal and motivation
I spend my free time constantly expanding my knowledge and skills in creating web applications, databases, security and backend solutions.
I will be grateful for the criticism and comments on my repositories. 

May the Code, be with You!
